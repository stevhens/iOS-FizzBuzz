## Outline

This app makes me learn about Unit Test and UI Test. This app developed in SwiftUI.

## What is FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is an group word game app for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".

## What I've learnt
